## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Configure Models** (in sidebar):
   - **Embedding Type**: Choose `openai`, `sentence-transformer`, or `ollama`
   - **Embedding Model**: e.g., `text-embedding-3-small` or `mistral`
   - **LLM Provider**: Select `openai` or `ollama`
   - **LLM Model**: e.g., `gpt-4` (recommended for legal) or `mistral`
   - **Temperature**: `0.2` (default - low for precise legal analysis)

2. **Upload Legal Document**:
   - Click "Browse files" in sidebar
   - Select your legal PDF (contract, statute, case law, etc.)
   - Click "Process PDF"
   - Wait for processing with legal-optimized chunking

3. **Ask Legal Questions**:
   - Type your legal question (e.g., "What are the termination clauses?")
   - Receive IRAC-formatted analysis (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion)
   - Expand "View Sources" to see exact legal provisions cited

### Understanding Key Settings

#### Temperature (0.0 - 1.0)
Controls response randomness and creativity:
- **0.1 - 0.3**: Precise, factual legal analysis ‚≠ê **Recommended for legal documents** (Default: 0.2)
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Balanced (not recommended for legal)
- **0.7 - 1.0**: Creative, conversational (‚ö†Ô∏è high risk for legal analysis)

#### Chunk Size
Size of text segments for processing:
- **500-800**: Technical docs, structured content
- **1000-1200**: General documents
- **1500-2000**: Legal documents, long clauses ‚≠ê **Default for legal** (1500)
- **2000-3000**: Complex legal contracts with lengthy provisions

#### Chunk Overlap
Text overlap between consecutive chunks (prevents splitting important legal clauses):
- Rule of thumb: **15-25% of chunk size**
- Legal documents: **250-400** (higher overlap critical for legal context)
- Default: 300 (optimized for legal chunk size 1500)

#### Chunks to Retrieve
**NOT the total chunks in your document!** This is the number of most relevant legal passages sent to the LLM per question.
- **2-3**: Very specific clause lookups
- **4-5**: Balanced for general documents
- **6-8**: Legal analysis needing comprehensive context ‚≠ê **Default for legal** (6)
- **8-12**: Complex legal questions spanning multiple provisions

**Example**: A 200-chunk document with "retrieve 6" means each query finds the 6 most relevant legal chunks from all 200, ignoring the rest.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Understanding IRAC Method

**IRAC** is the standard framework for legal analysis used by attorneys, law students, and legal professionals:

### What is IRAC?

- **I**ssue: Identify the specific legal question or problem
- **R**ule: State the applicable law, regulation, or principle
- **A**pplication: Apply the rule to the specific facts
- **C**onclusion: Provide the answer or outcome

### Example IRAC Analysis

**Question**: "What are the termination provisions in this employment contract?"

**ISSUE:**
The issue is whether the employment contract contains provisions allowing for termination and under what circumstances termination may occur.

**RULE:**
According to Section 8.2 of the Employment Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. Section 8.3 provides for immediate termination for cause, including material breach, fraud, or gross negligence.

**APPLICATION:**
The contract explicitly provides two termination mechanisms. For routine termination without cause, the 30-day notice requirement under Section 8.2 must be satisfied. However, if the employer can demonstrate cause as defined in Section 8.3 (material breach, fraud, or gross negligence), immediate termination is permitted without the 30-day notice period.

**CONCLUSION:**
The contract allows termination in two ways: (1) with 30 days written notice for any reason, or (2) immediately for cause as specifically defined in Section 8.3.

- LLM: `gpt-4` (best for legal nuance)
- Chunk Size: `1500`
- Chunks to Retrieve: `6`
- Temperature: `0.2`

**Example Legal Questions:**
```
‚Ä¢ What are the termination provisions in this contract?
‚Ä¢ What are the non-compete obligations?
‚Ä¢ What remedies are available for breach of contract?
‚Ä¢ What is the governing law and jurisdiction?
‚Ä¢ What are the confidentiality requirements?
‚Ä¢ What are the compensation and benefits terms?
```

### Example 2: Commercial Lease Agreement

**Recommended Settings:**
- Embedding: `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI)
- LLM: `gpt-4`
- Chunk Size: `1800`
- Chunks to Retrieve: `7`
- Temperature: `0.2`

**Example Legal Questions:**
```
‚Ä¢ What are the rent escalation clauses?
‚Ä¢ What are the tenant's maintenance obligations?
‚Ä¢ What constitutes a default under this lease?
‚Ä¢ What are the options for lease renewal?
‚Ä¢ What are the permitted uses of the premises?
```

### Example 3: Regulatory Compliance Document

**Recommended Settings:**

# Pull models optimized for legal analysis
ollama pull mistral      # Good general model
ollama pull llama2       # Alternative model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # Best for embeddings
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Embedding: `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama)
- LLM: `mistral` (Ollama)
- Chunk Size: `1500`
- Chunks to Retrieve: `6`
- Temperature: `0.2`

**Benefits for Legal Practice:**
- ‚úÖ **100% Private**: No data leaves your computer
- ‚úÖ **Client Confidentiality**: Attorney-client privilege maintained
- ‚úÖ **Completely Free**: No per-document or per-query costs
- ‚úÖ **No Rate Limits**: Analyze as many documents as needed
- ‚úÖ **Works Offline**: No internet required

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not found"
- Ensure `.env` file exists with valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check the key hasn't expired and has credits
- Try: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` before running

### "Ollama not available"
- Check if Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Verify base URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
- Install models: `ollama pull mistral`
- Restart Streamlit app after installing models

### "Error processing PDF"
- Ensure PDF is not encrypted or password-protected
- Try a different PDF to verify system works
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Click "Reset All" in sidebar to start fresh

### ChromaDB Issues
- Delete `chroma_db` directory to reset: `rm -rf chroma_db`
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try reprocessing the document

### Python Version Issues
- Use Python 3.8 or higher (3.13 tested and supported)
- On macOS: use `python3` instead of `python`
- Ensure virtual environment is activated

### Import Errors
- Make sure virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For Python 3.13 compatibility issues with tiktoken: Set `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`

## üîß Advanced Legal Usage

### Legal Question Optimization

#### ‚ùå **Bad Legal Questions:**
- "Tell me about this contract"
- "What's in this document?"
- "Summarize everything"

#### ‚úÖ **Good Legal Questions:**
- "What are the termination provisions in this agreement?"
- "What remedies are available for breach under Section 10?"
- "What are the indemnification obligations of each party?"
- "What events constitute a material breach?"
- "What is the statute of limitations for claims under this contract?"
- "What are the conditions precedent to the buyer's obligations?"

### Multi-step Legal Analysis
```
1. "What is the main purpose of this agreement?"
2. "What are the key obligations of each party?"
3. "What are the termination rights?"
4. "What dispute resolution mechanism is specified?"
5. "What is the governing law and jurisdiction?"
```

### Contract Drafting Review
```
1. "Are there any undefined terms in this agreement?"
2. "What notice requirements are specified?"
3. "Are there any automatic renewal clauses?"
4. "What are the limitation of liability provisions?"
5. "Are there any missing standard clauses?"
```

### Using Source References (Critical for Legal Work)
- **ALWAYS** check "View Sources" to verify legal citations
- Source documents show exact contractual language used
- Verify section numbers and clause references
- Never rely solely on AI summary for legal advice
- Use sources to quote exact contract language in memos

---

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Token Usage (for OpenAI)
```
Total tokens ‚âà (chunk_size √ó chunks_to_retrieve) + question + response
```
- Keep under model limits:
  - GPT-3.5: ~4K tokens
  - GPT-4: ~8K tokens
  - GPT-4-turbo: ~128K tokens

### Processing Time
- First PDF processing: Slower (creating embeddings)
- Subsequent queries: Fast (using stored embeddings)
- Local models (Ollama): Slower inference, but no API latency
